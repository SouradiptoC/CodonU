Data Recoding
To add computation codonW converts sequence information 
automatically from it original text format into a numerical format. 
This is normally transparent to the user. To add additional genetic 
codes or a personal choice of codon values for calculating the Fop, 
CAI or CBI indices, some understanding of the schema used to convert 
the sequences to numerical strings is advisable. 

When calculating the indices Fop, CBI, or CAI which are measure of 
codon bias in relation to the codon usage of a set of optimal genes, 
there is an option of using a personal choice of these values. These 
are read from file, there must be one value for each codon (64 in 
total) and they must be found in the file in a set sequence (i.e. 
the numerical order of the codons, TTT, TCT ... GAG, GGG). This is 
also the order in which codon and amino acid results are recorded to 
file.

Internally CodonW recodes all nucleotides, codons and amino acids. 
Nucleotides are recoded as T/U=1, C=2, A=3, G=4. The 20 standard 
amino acids and the termination codons are recoded as integer values 
in the range 1 to 21, note that stop codons is assigned the amino 
acid value 11 (see Table 2). The decision about whether a codon is 
synonymous, or how many members are in a particular amino acid 
synonymous family are taken at run time and are dependent on the 
genetic code chosen.  

Each codon is recoded into an integer value in the range 1 to 64, 
see Table 1. The formulae used to recode the codons is:

Equation 1
        	
code=((p1-1)*16)+P2+((p3-1)*4)    1<= code <= 64

Where each of the three codon positions is represented by P1, P2 and 
P3. Using this recoding convention, the codon ATG has the value 45. 
 		
code=((3-1)*16)+1+((4-1)*4)=45

Unrecognised or non-translatable bases, codons or amino acids are 
represented all assigned the value zero.
