________________________________________________________________________________
Total gene count: 2
Value Ranges:
    GRAVY:
        - > 0: The protein is relatively hydrophobic
        - < 0: The protein is relatively hydrophilic
        - nan: There are no synonymous codons
    Aromaticity:
        - 0: The protein consists 0 aromatic residues
        - > 0: The protein consists aromatic residues
        - Higher the value is, higher are the number of aromatics residues in the protein
